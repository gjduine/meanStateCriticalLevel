# meanStateCriticalLevel
Mean State Critical Level (MSCL) is the level in the atmosphere where cross-barrier winds drop to zero. 

This is relevant for mountain waves and downslope windstorms. The presence of MSCL acts as a lid in the atmosphere, reflecting gravity waves downward in the lee of a mountain range. It has been found in Duine et al. submitted to WAF that lee slope winds accelerate stronger and faster in situations with than without MSCL, thereby amplifying hazardous winds and enhancing wildfire conditions
The pre-requisite for a MSCL is upstream momentum approaching the mountain range.
