# meanStateCriticalLevel
Mean State Critical Level (MSCL) is the level in the atmosphere where cross-barrier winds drop to zero. 

This is a relevant feature for mountain wave and downslope windstorm development. The presence of MSCL acts as a lid in the atmosphere, reflecting gravity waves downward in the lee of a mountain range. It has been found in Duine et al. submitted to Weather and Forecasting journal that lee slope winds accelerate more in situations with than without MSCL, amplifying hazardous winds and enhancing wildfire conditions.
The level is found from a vertical profile upstream of the mountain range. Can be applied to both radiosondes and model data
